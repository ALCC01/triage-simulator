# ⛑️ Triage Simulator

Triage Simulator is a simple web app that allows healthcare and emergency
workers to learn and become familiar with triage protocols for mass casualty
incidents. The project aims to provide users with a readily available tool to
test and refresh their triage skills. The app currently supports the START
triage algorithm (Benson et al, 1996).

You can see a demo deployment [here](https://triage.pages.dev).

## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:ALCC01/triage-simulator.git
    cd triage-simulator
    npm install

## Building

    npm run build

## Hosting

You can run a development server using `npm run dev`. Use `npm run preview` to
serve the build artifacts from the `dist` folder in a production-like
environment.

Production builds should probably sit behind a proper web server or deploy to a
static site hosting platform.
