        Welcome to <strong>â›‘ Triage Simulator</strong>! This app allows you to
        learn and gain familiarity with triage protocols for mass casualty
        incidents. It currently supports the START triage algorithm (Benson et
        al, 1996).
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-black mt-4 mb-2">How it works</h3>
      <ol className="mb-2 pl-2 list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          Use <strong><Icon n="add" className='text-xl/6 align-bottom' /> New
            disaster</strong> to generate a new set of patients. You can always
          use <strong><Icon n="restart_alt" className='text-xl/6 align-bottom' /> New
          game</strong> to get another one
        </li>
        <li>
          Your patient list displays your patients. Click on a patient to open
          their triage tag. Once you have assigned a code to a patient, its
          colour will update to reflect your choice
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the buttons in the triage tag to check for vital signs or to
          perform actions, such as placing an airway. The triage tag will update
          with the values you have observed. Once you have reached a conclusion,
          assign a code to the patient by clicking on the appropriate colour
        </li>
        <li>
          You can use <Icon n="visibility" className='text-xl/6 align-bottom' /> in
          the patient list to show which patients have been correctly
          triaged and to show individual feedback on each patient under their
          triage tag
        </li>
        <li>
          Use <Icon n="show_chart" className='text-xl/6 align-bottom' /> to
          display statistics such as the levels of over and under-triage
        </li>
      </ol>
